# Data-Analysis-on-Energy-Demand
Working with Excel worksheets to present data analysis that will help to efficiently manage the supply of electricity as the demand can vary from day to day.

- Processed and structured raw data to improve understanding.
- For initial analysis, only the top and bottom 20 rows were extracted.
- The data's minimum, maximum, and average demand were summarized.
- Line chart to analyze the energy demand over time.
- The impact of everyday weather on energy demand has been discovered.
- Extracted and evaluated if school days, holidays, and work days have an influence on energy usage.
- Data on energy demand for each year was analyzed in order to compare and draw conclusions.
- Examined weekly energy demand and used conditional formatting to make the data more comprehensible.
